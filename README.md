for overview:
- tala is supposed to be a programming language
- sua is supposed to be a configuration/json-like language (w/ hybrid macros)
- baga is supposed to be a build system built around all of these programs

- dara is supposed to be a CUI shell
- tara is supposed to be a universal string manipulation + command output helping program (piping, config swapping, files to arguments, etc)
- fala is supposed to be a terminal benchmarker + context tracker (keeps terminal context and program execution in track) + as well as a way to get terminal safety protocols (briefing will be done soon)

- all the tertiary ones are self explanatory but side note for the sandboxed execution program, it will actually be related to all the other programs, however that is not shown directly in the diagram as it would be too tiresome
